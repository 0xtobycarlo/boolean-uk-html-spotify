# Spotify

Today we are building the UI for Spotify. This exercise will put into practice everything we have learned about HTML & CSS. Layouts for apps are different to websites so this will put your CSS Grid skills to the test!

## Instructions
In the `screens` folder you will see images of spotify at different resolutions. Your goal is replicate this layout as closely as possible. The image assets needed to complete the exercise are in the `assets/img` folder.

- Add HTML elements
- Add text, images and logos
- Use CSS Grid for the layout and components
- Use CSS for styling

## Tips
- Breakdown the app into sections
- Work section by section until it's complete

## Challenge
- Refactor your CSS; look for repetition in your CSS styles and replace it with classes
